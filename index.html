			<p>So Summer is here for California, yay! Not! lol. I definitely do not like hot weather. My husband and I put up our air conditioner in the room yesterday. Anyway i haven't been coding as much because I need to learn the tools I need to make this blog more "bloggy" dynamic, not sure what I am trying to say. But this is definitely a static blog and I want to change that. I'm not focusing on colors, etc because I want this blog to look professional. If anyone wants to see something more joyful there is an <a href="https://code.sololearn.com/Wd2UcbXrKtoy/?ref=app" target="_blank">about me</a> link in my navigation. That is my first code on SL and I put a lot of time and effort into it's design. So check that out! </p>
			<p>So I will be working mostly on freecodecamp but I will be completing challenges and learning from the courses on SL if anyone was wondering lol</p>

	<p>So on freecodecamp.org I have to build a tribute page. Ahhh the terror of a high school research paper coupled with no inspiration is biting at me. So it boils down to my favorite actor OR a film director I would like to know more about. Arrows point one way but which would be more interesting?</p>

		<p>Well...I didn't get a tattoo. I'm getting my teeth fixed instead *eyeroll* lol It's super off topic but putting off dental health is bad! Everyone go to the dentist regularly! I had several cavities ouch!</p>
		<p> On a happier note, I have been using <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp.org</a> and I like it. It complements SL beautifully. It's were I learned what Bootstrap does. And then here on SL I get to read the lessons and apply the new knowledge into my code. I also want to learn how to use Github, it's so confusing for my noob head!</p>

		<span class="badge">April 13, 2018</span><p>Happy Friday the 13th! My local tattoo shop has tattoo specials on this day. It is possible I will be getting a tattoo today. (lol) But on a more serious note. Thank you to everyone that has <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i> <i class="far fa-comment"></i> on my work. I have a lot to learn so every little bit of motivation helps me greatly! As of right now I'm trying to incorporate more JS and Bootstrap into this blog. </p>

	<p><i class="fab fa-js"></i> is hard. I found a list code from W3 schools. I tried taking the CSS and JS off it and into their corresponding sections on SL but in the event of doing so I messed up the code. Now I get two different errors. The first one shows up before running the code. It says I'm redefining a variable again ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«. The second one says that my list is null. So I'm lost. If anyone would like to help me that would be so awesome.</p><p><b>quick update</b>: i started over with this code and it is working again. yay 04/13/18.</p>

<p>I have seen JS used to make grocery lists. Perhaps that can be a mini project for me. Also going to the movies later!<br>

	<p>I reached level 10 yesterday. <a href="https://code.sololearn.com/WgieUz0fy6y7/?ref=app">Here</a> is a JavaScript activity I did this morning. Eventually I want to add more JS to this blog, like "Next" and "Previous" buttons. Maybe some hovering effects. Any tips welcome.
