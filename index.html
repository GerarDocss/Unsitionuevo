                Hola! Yo soy<strong>Gerardo</strong>. Coding has changed my world. It's not just about apps.
                Learning to code gave me <i>problem-solving skills</i> and a way to communicate with others on a 
                technical level. I can also develop websites and use my coding skills to get a better job. 
                And I learned it all at <strong>SoloLearn</strong> where they build your self-esteem and keep you motivated. 
                Join me in this rewarding journey. You'll have fun, get help, and learn along the way!
            </p>
